Use for anything that doesn't fit the other categories.

## Tips for Effective Requests

### ✅ **Do This**
- **Be specific**: Instead of "fix the system," say "students can't register for Drama Club"
- **Provide examples**: "John Smith's email john@mergington.edu gives an error"
- **Explain the impact**: "Teachers can't register students for the spring play auditions"
- **Fill out all required fields**: This helps get your request implemented faster

### ❌ **Avoid This**
- Don't leave required fields blank
- Don't use technical jargon - describe things in everyday terms
- Don't combine multiple different requests in one issue
- Don't worry about how to implement it - just describe what you need
