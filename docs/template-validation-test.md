# Test Issue: Add Photography Club

**This is a test issue to validate that our issue templates provide sufficient detail for Copilot to implement.**

## Scenario
A teacher wants to add a new Photography Club to the activity management system.

## Template Form Data (from add-new-activity.yml)

### Activity Information
- **Activity Name**: Photography Club
- **Description**: Students will learn basic photography principles, explore different photography techniques, and work on creative projects. Monthly photo walks and exhibitions.
- **Meeting Days**: Tuesday, Thursday
- **Start Time**: 15:15
- **End Time**: 17:00
- **Maximum Participants**: 18
- **Additional Information**: Students should bring their own cameras (smartphones acceptable). No prior experience required.

## Generated Requirements for Copilot

Based on the template, Copilot should:

### Acceptance Criteria âœ…
- [ ] Activity appears in the activities list
- [ ] Students can register for the Photography Club
- [ ] Activity shows correct schedule (Tuesdays and Thursdays, 3:15 PM - 5:00 PM)
- [ ] Activity shows participant limit (18 students)
- [ ] Activity displays properly on both desktop and mobile

### Technical Implementation ðŸ”§
Add to `src/backend/database.py` in the `initial_activities` dictionary:

```python
"Photography Club": {
    "description": "Students will learn basic photography principles, explore different photography techniques, and work on creative projects. Monthly photo walks and exhibitions.",
    "schedule": "Tuesdays and Thursdays, 3:15 PM - 5:00 PM",
    "schedule_details": {
        "days": ["Tuesday", "Thursday"],
        "start_time": "15:15",
        "end_time": "17:00"
    },
    "max_participants": 18,
    "participants": []
}
```

## Validation Assessment

### âœ… **Sufficient Information Provided**
1. **Clear Problem**: Add new activity with specific details
2. **Complete Specification**: All required fields filled out
3. **Technical Context**: Exact code structure and file location provided
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear, testable outcomes defined
5. **Non-Technical Language**: Easy for teachers to understand and complete

### âœ… **Copilot Can Implement Without Further Questions**
- Exact activity name provided
- Complete description given
- Schedule clearly specified in both human-readable and structured format
- Participant limit defined
- File location and code structure specified
- Data format matches existing patterns

### âœ… **Template Design Success**
- Required fields ensure completeness
- Dropdown menus standardize input
- Technical notes provide implementation guidance
- Acceptance criteria provide testing framework
- Examples and placeholders guide user input

## Conclusion

This test demonstrates that the issue templates successfully bridge the gap between non-technical teacher needs and technical implementation requirements. A teacher can easily fill out the form, and Copilot receives all necessary information to implement the request without additional clarification.

The templates achieve the goal of simplifying change requests for teachers while providing sufficient detail for automated implementation.
